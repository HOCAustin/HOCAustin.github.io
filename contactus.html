		<h3>Interested In Applying?</h3>
		<h4>If you would like to become a member of the house, there are a couple of steps you need to complete.</h4>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Fill out the new member application using the link below. Your application will be posted in the house for residents to review. 
				If any members express any concerns, they will be discussed at the next meeting and your application for membership will be reconsidered then.
				If your application is posted and no concerns or dissents are expressed, then you are automatically accepted into the house.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Visit the house on two occasions. For most people, this means attending two house dinners (Sunday-Thursday at 6:30PM), or a house dinner 
				and a house meeting, house meetings take place on Sunday after dinner at about 7:00 PM but any occasion where several members are able to
				talk with you should be fine. The exception to this rule would be for applicants who are unable 
				to visit the house because of geographic constraints (out of state, international students, etc.). If this is the case with you, please send 
				a message to the membership officer explaining your situation using the contact form and we will arrange a Skype session.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Fill out an application with the ICC office. The exception to this is if you are taking over a current resident's lease, in which case DO NOT 
				CONTACT THE OFFICE UNTIL THE LEASE TRANSFER HAS BEEN ARRANGED. These steps do not have to be followed in any specific order, but all need to be completed before you are able to become a member
			of the house.</li><h4>
