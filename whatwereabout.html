	<h3>Culture</h3>
	<p>House of Commons also known as "HOC" has an eclectic and diverse house culture and has held a reputation for being a little different from the other houses in ICC. We come from all 
	certain aspects -- what seems to unite us as a house are our individual differences. Meals are vegan and most of 
	the food purchased by the house is organically grown and produced. Meat is not allowed on the property despite being a vegan/vegetarian house, our members 
	range in diet from strict vegan to omnivore. We are a motley crew, our occupations range from undergraduate/international/graduate students to
    working professionals. As a cooperative the house provides a social structure that cannot be found in places such as
	dorms and apartments. House work is shared which allows us to exist as a community and provide affordable housing. All major decisions involving the house
	are made using a system of modified consensus, allowing all members to participate in the decision-making process.</p>
